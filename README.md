Official Documentation for ISGCN (Interactive Spatial-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network)

This is the official documentation for the ISGCN model, published in the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS).

Introduction:

The ISGCN model is designed for accurate spatial-temporal traffic prediction, a critical task in urban transportation systems. The model introduces a novel dynamic graph convolution module that captures both broad spatial correlations and hidden dynamic spatial correlations over time. By integrating graph convolution with temporal sample convolution and interaction blocks, ISGCN excels in learning complex multi-scale temporal and dynamic spatial dependencies. This framework has demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art models in experiments using multiple real-world traffic datasets.

Data Sources

The ISGCN model has been evaluated on several real-world traffic datasets, including PeMS04, PeMS07, PeMS08, and PeMS-BAY, covering traffic flow and speed data across various regions and time intervals. These datasets provide comprehensive coverage of traffic conditions and serve as benchmarks to illustrate the model's effectiveness.
